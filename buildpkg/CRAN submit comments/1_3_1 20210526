Submitting new version to update archived version. * Updated all T and F values to TRUE and FALSE respectively. 

* Several examples take a while to run and have been marked with 'donttest' but have been tested with check(run_dont_test = TRUE)

* Previous comments have asked not to change par() if possible. The only par calls in the current version should be lines 203 and 230 in methods-plot.R. These are necessary and in one case only creates a new plot and in the other passes declared par arguments to a call in a function.
